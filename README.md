# Fair Access To Education

A group project submitted for Foundations of Data Science at Northeastern University.

We wanted to identify factors that affect access to education around the globe using the publicly available Human Development World Index Dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/human-development-index-dataset).

We conducted data analysis utilizing K-Nearest Neighbors, SVMs, and Random Forests to identify the most important features that affected the mean years of schooling and other factors relating to educational access in a country.

The poster with our project overview, written analysis, and conclusions is included in the project, as well as our results in the Jupyter Notebook.
